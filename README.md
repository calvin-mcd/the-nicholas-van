# The Nicholas Van
 
The Nicholas Van is an EC (topre) pcb for trashman's vanagon keyboard. The pcb supports a both the 625U spacebar, and the split 275U, 225U spacebars. But each need their own respective plate. 
Plate files for Hull and Embrace cases are available. Check the plate & hardware section for what you will need. 
The pcb comes with a usb port by default, but supports a Daughterboard connector (either jst or pico). It also supports another 5pin Jst connector for the Rotary Encoder board from the Embrace.

## Firmware

The basic EC firmware is ready to go and the source code is provided for tweaking any settings.

## Plates & Hardware

Plate files are available for OEM (original and deskey housings), for each respective bottom row choice, and for the original plate, Hull and Embrace cases.

Furthermore, you will need 26x 10mm M2 screws and M2 nuts to assemble the pcb. O-rings might help aligning the pcb and usb port in some cases, but is not required.
